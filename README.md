## Experience 10+ years

### Machine Learning Engineer, Zillow (Zestimate), Remote (Sep 2021 -- Present)
- **Listing IQ: Interactive CMA Platform (Django, DocumentDB, PyTorch)**
  - Led proof-of-concept and core architecture for platform now live as Listing IQ CMA -- AI-powered tool enabling agents to customize property comparisons with map-based filtering, editable valuations, and amenity-level explanations.
  - Designed APIs integrating real-time Zestimate valuations, property embeddings, and comparative analysis.
  - Mentored junior engineer through production launch.
  - Impact: POC to shipped product powering agent pricing decisions; foundation for new agent revenue products.

- **Active Listing Comps Engine (Apache Spark, Metaflow, H3 Geospatial)**
  - Architected and built similar listings comparison engine from ground up -- batch pipeline and real-time API using H3 geospatial indexing and customizable ranking algorithms.
  - Processes 3M+ listings, powers Zillow Showcase dashboards (8M monthly views) helping agents demonstrate listing performance vs non-Showcase homes.
  - Later led infrastructure migration and algorithm improvements.
  - Impact: 95% complaint reduction, coverage 90% to 98.5%; metrics cited in sales, marketing, and investor communications.

- **Infrastructure & Engineering Leadership (Terraform, AWS, Metaflow, Docker)**
  - Drove CICD V4 migration and ML pipeline modernization with zero production incidents.
  - Led alert reduction initiatives and bug triage coordination.
  - Conduct technical interviews, mentor junior engineers, and lead code reviews across team.
  - Impact: $500K annual savings, 61% alert reduction (641 to 249 alerts YoY).

- **AI/ML Initiatives (In Progress) (PyTorch, CLIP, LangChain, Databricks, MLflow)**
  - Leading Image Embeddings project -- designing DualLossAutoEncoder to predict property condition from CLIP embeddings (3.3M listings) for Zestimate integration (DRI, cross-team coordination with computer vision and valuation teams).
  - Co-developed customer care tool alpha -- React UI and LLM integration enabling agents to generate personalized, AI-powered Zestimate explanations.
  - Impact: Advancing visual ML and LLM capabilities for valuation products; first LLM tool deployed to customer care.

### Machine Learning Engineer, OkCupid (Match.com), New York City (May 2020 - Sep 2021)
- **Discount Optimization (Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Weights and Biases)**
  - Led efforts to optimize subscription pricing (discounts) to maximize revenue for OkCupid.
  - Implemented end-to-end ML pipelines, feature engineering, modeling, alerting, etc.
  - Impact: Increased overall revenue by 6% through A/B testing against assigned prices.

### Machine Learning Engineer, FactSet, New York City (Apr 2015 - May 2020)
- **ML-Powered Financial Data Extraction (Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Sagemaker)**
  - Led multiple ML initiatives: Speaker identification system for earnings calls using spectrograms and CNNs, Private company fact extraction from 1.6M websites using ELMo/BiLSTM.
  - Built end-to-end pipelines from data collection to deployment.
  - Impact: 20% reduction in human-hours for earnings call processing, automated extraction from millions of documents.

- **Financial Document Search & Ranking Systems (Apache Spark, Java, Python)**
  - Architected search infrastructure: Type-ahead and query expansion for document search, Real-time formula ranking using language models, Duplicate document detection service.
  - Scaled to handle thousands of queries/documents per day.
  - Impact: Improved formula ranking from 5.6 to 2.3, 66% faster document processing, powered StreetAccount trending news.

### ML Research Engineer, Tata Research Development and Design Centre, India (July 2011 - July 2013)
- **Event Detection in Time Series (Java, Python, RapidMiner)**
  - Wrote an algorithm based on Shape Context for finding frequently occurring patterns and events, with as good results as SAX, DTW etc. with 7% better results in the particular domain of car sensors.

- **Data Harmonization Framework (DHF) (Java, Apache Pig)**
  - Implemented an ETL framework that exploits the power of map-reduce and big-databases to fuse incongruous enterprise data from disparate sources in near real time.
